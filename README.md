|  T cell only | scGPT  | 0.2396  | 0.4246  | 0.2388  | 0.87  | 0.89  |
|  T cell only | contrastiveVI  | 0.3001  | 0.5084  | 0.3145  | 0.87  | 0.89  |
|  Full PBMC | scGPT -> contrastiveVI  | 0.3581  | 0.5357  | 0.3421  | 0.86  | 0.89  |
|  Full PBMC | contrastiveVI -> contrastiveVI | 0.1642  | 0.2188  | 0.0949  | 0.56  | 0.61  |

*Note: SAVER model nearest-neighbor accuracy is not included as it does not produce a latent space representation.*

*Note: scGPT -> contrastiveVI: Full PBMC data was batch corrected using scGPT before being utilized for training with contrastiveVI.*

*Note: contrastiveVI -> contrastiveVI: Full PBMC data was batch corrected using contrastiveVIâ€™s built-in function before being utilized for training with contrastiveVI.*
